# Zillow Chrome Extension 🏠 

This repo is for a simple chrome extension that allows users to export listing data from a zillow search as a CSV and get the median and mean sold home prices in an area. It was created for a tutorial on building a zillow chrome extension with react. If you have any questions with the code or how to get things set up, I recommend reading the blog posts links below.
